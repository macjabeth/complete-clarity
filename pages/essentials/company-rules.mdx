---

## Respect Each Other

Treat everyone the way you'd like to be treated. No toxicity, elitism, shock humor, sexism, racism, or hate speech of any kind. Do not seek, instigate, or cause drama. Don't negatively affect the experience of any other player.

## Be Kind

Share. Don't be greedy. Remember that it's not all about you. Help each other.

## Language

Some off-colour language is fine, but keep it reasonable.

## Messaging

No excessive messaging, spamming, badgering, or harassment in DMs, groups, or company chat.

## Discord

Your Discord nickname must exactly match your New World username. If you change your username, also change your nickname on Discord.

Additionally, let a `@Consul` or `@Officer` member know so that we can add a member note about it.
