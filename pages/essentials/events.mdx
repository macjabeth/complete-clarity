# Events

## Organisers

Players who are interested in running events may be given the `Event Organizer` role on Discord, which has nearly admin powers in the `#company-events` Discord channel.

These players are responsible for gauging and gathering interest, and planning and running company events. Players may lose their Event Organizer role if they don't run events.
