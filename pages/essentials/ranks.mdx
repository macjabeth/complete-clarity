# Ranks

Here are all the ranks in New World companies and all the responsibilities they have.

## Governor

The Governor will be able to manage all the ranks of the players in the company.

## Consul

Consuls have permission on everything from lower ranks plus a few others. They can set the message of the day for company members to read.

Consuls and the Governor have their own private chat room that cannot be seen and read by Officers and Settlers.

They also have the ability to declare war and set the siege window. This includes managing the players who are signing up for the war/fight and arranging them by groups.

## Officer

Has the ability to make withdrawals from the Company Treasury. Officers can also start and cancel territory upgrades.

If the Governor or Consul is not online, they can start territory upgrades so it finishes in time before sieges happen. These upgrades are mainly for defenses used against the attacking company and it would be best to have them up in time during the time of the siege.

Officers also have the power to invite members to the company. They can also kick other Settler-ranked players. They will not be able to promote other players as promoting a Settler would give them the same rank as the Officer which is not possible.

## Settler

The starting rank for new players joining our ranks.

Permissions are minimalised into chatting with the company and making deposits to the treasury.
